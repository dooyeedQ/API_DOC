     Example of five of seven:
    * context：
The first microscopes powerful enough to distinguish blood cells were invented in the 1600s. By the early 1800s, scientists were able to distinguish white          blood cells from red blood cells. However, they didn't yet understand white blood cells' role in the immune system, helping to fight infection and other diseases. For that matter, they didn't understand there was such a thing as the immune system. Instead, they thought that these strange cells might be mucous or pus.In the 1840s and 1850s, several doctors wrote case studies of people who had swollen abdomens, fevers, weight loss, and weakness — symptoms that we now associate with leukemia. While performing blood tests during autopsies, the doctors noticed that these people had abnormal amounts of white blood cells — so much so that they described the disease as "white blood" or "leukemia." The name "leukemia" was derived from the Greek words "leukos," which means "white," and "haima," which means "blood." Doctors debated the cause of this abnormal level of white blood cells. In 1856, Rudolf Virchow, a German physician and pioneer in cellular pathology, proposed that the cause of leukemia would be found in the organs that produced the white blood cells — especially the spleen. Other doctors found that people with leukemia had bone marrow that was yellowish-green, instead of the normal, healthy red. Leukemia wasn't just a disease of the organs: The bones were involved as well. This destruction of the bone marrow accounted for the anemia (lack of red blood cells) that went along with leukemia.
